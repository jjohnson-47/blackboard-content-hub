# Iframe Testing Tool Enhancement Plan

This document outlines the plan for enhancing the iframe testing tool in the Blackboard Content Hub. The tool will provide a streamlined environment for testing iframe-based educational components before embedding them in Blackboard.

## Focus Areas

### 1. Enhanced Code Editor Appearance and Usability
- Improve syntax highlighting with a modern, readable theme
- Add code folding for better navigation
- Implement basic Prettier formatting for readability
- Add simple keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Focus on visual appeal rather than complex editing features

### 2. Robust Session Management
- Implement LocalStorage persistence for projects
- Add auto-save functionality to prevent loss of work
- Implement session recovery for browser refreshes

### 3. Streamlined Project Organization
- Sort projects by last modified date (most recent at top)
- Add basic project metadata (name, description, last modified)
- Implement a clean, visual project listing

### 4. Polished UI/UX
- Apply design principles from the design-principles-demo
- Improve visual feedback for actions
- Enhance error reporting with clear, helpful messages
- Ensure responsive design for different device sizes

## Implementation Priorities

### 1. Visual Appeal and Usability First
- Focus on making the interface clean, modern, and intuitive
- Ensure the preview accurately represents how the iframe will look in Blackboard
- Prioritize smooth transitions between editing and previewing

### 2. Reliable State Management
- Ensure projects are saved reliably to LocalStorage
- Implement auto-recovery of unsaved changes
- Make project switching seamless

### 3. Future-Proof Architecture
- Design the system to allow for future enhancements (server-side storage, authentication, collaboration)
- Use modular code structure for easy extension
- Document the architecture for future development

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Code Editor Enhancements (1-2 days)
- Update CodeMirror configuration for better appearance
- Add code folding capabilities
- Implement Prettier formatting

### Phase 2: Session Management (1-2 days)
- Implement LocalStorage persistence
- Add auto-save functionality
- Implement session recovery

### Phase 3: Project Organization (1 day)
- Sort projects by last modified date
- Enhance project metadata
- Implement clean project listing

### Phase 4: UI/UX Improvements (1-2 days)
- Apply design principles
- Improve feedback mechanisms
- Enhance error reporting

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation (1 day)
- Test all features
- Document the implementation
- Create user guide

## Technical Implementation Details

The implementation will build upon the existing development preview UI, which already includes:
- A code editor with separate tabs for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- A preview panel that renders the iframe content
- Device testing options (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)
- Basic component management (create, save, load)
- CodeMirror integration for syntax highlighting

The enhancements will focus on improving the user experience, ensuring reliable state management, and creating a visually appealing interface that makes testing iframe components a smooth and efficient process.
