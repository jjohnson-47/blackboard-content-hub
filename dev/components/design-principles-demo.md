# Design Principles Demo: Interactive Canvas Tool

This component demonstrates the application of game design principles to educational tools, as outlined in the [Design Principles Guide](../../docs/developer-guide/design-principles.md).

## Overview

The Interactive Canvas Tool is a simple drawing application that allows users to create and manipulate shapes on a canvas. It demonstrates key design principles including:

1. **Clear Purpose Definition**: A focused tool for creating and manipulating geometric shapes
2. **Intuitive Layout**: Separation of canvas and controls with logical grouping
3. **Visual Design Elements**: Consistent color scheme, typography, and modern UI elements
4. **Interactive Controls**: Various control types (buttons, sliders, toggles, dropdowns)
5. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Coordinate display, status messages, and visual feedback

## Design Implementation

### Layout Organization

The component follows a clear layout structure:

- **Canvas Area**: The main workspace where users interact with shapes
- **Controls Panel**: Grouped controls for shape selection, appearance, and canvas options
- **Feedback Panel**: Displays coordinates and status messages

This organization follows the principle of grouping related controls and providing clear visual separation between different functional areas.

### Visual Design

The component uses:

- A limited color palette with purple as the primary accent color
- Consistent typography with clear hierarchy
- Visual feedback for interactive elements (hover states, active states)
- Appropriate spacing and padding for readability

### Interactive Controls

The component demonstrates various control types:

- **Dropdown Menus**: For selecting shape types
- **Color Pickers**: For selecting fill and stroke colors
- **Sliders**: For adjusting stroke width and grid size
- **Checkboxes**: For toggling grid and snap-to-grid functionality
- **Buttons**: For clear, undo, and save actions

Each control provides immediate visual feedback and is clearly labeled.

### Feedback Mechanisms

The component provides multiple forms of feedback:

- Real-time coordinate display as the user moves the mouse
- Status messages that update based on user actions
- Visual feedback when drawing shapes
- Loading indicator for asynchronous operations (save)

### Responsive Design

The component is designed to work across different screen sizes:

- On larger screens, the canvas and controls display side-by-side
- On smaller screens, the layout shifts to a vertical arrangement
- The canvas resizes to fit the available space

## Educational Applications

This component could be used in various educational contexts:

- **Geometry Education**: Teaching about shapes, coordinates, and spatial relationships
- **Design Principles**: Demonstrating layout, color theory, and composition
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Creating step-by-step guides for drawing specific diagrams

## Implementation Notes

The component is implemented using:

- HTML5 Canvas for drawing
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- Responsive design techniques for different screen sizes

## Code Structure

The code is organized into clear sections:

1. **HTML Structure**: Defines the layout and UI elements
2. **CSS Styling**: Handles appearance and responsive behavior
3. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - Canvas initialization and resizing
   - Event handling for user interactions
   - Shape drawing and management
   - UI updates and feedback
