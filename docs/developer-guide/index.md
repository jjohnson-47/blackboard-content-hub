# Blackboard Content Hub Developer Guide

Welcome to the Developer Guide for the Blackboard Content Hub. This guide provides comprehensive documentation for developers who want to create, customize, and integrate interactive components for the Blackboard Learning Management System.

## Getting Started

The Blackboard Content Hub is designed to make it easy to create and deploy interactive educational content as iframes that can be embedded in Blackboard courses. This guide will help you understand the architecture, development workflow, and best practices for creating components.

## Component Development

### Component Types

The Blackboard Content Hub supports two types of components:

1. **Shared Components**: General-purpose components that can be used across multiple courses. These are stored in the `shared/components/` directory.

2. **Course-Specific Components**: Components designed specifically for a particular course. These are stored in the `courses/[course-id]/` directory.

### Component Structure

Each component consists of:

1. **HTML File**: The main component file that contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the component.
2. **Documentation**: A markdown file that describes the component, its usage, and implementation details.
3. **Metadata**: An entry in the `component-data.json` file that provides information about the component.

### Creating a New Component

To create a new component, use the component creation tool:

```bash
npm run new:component
```

This will guide you through the process of creating a new component, including:

1. Choosing the component type (shared or course-specific)
2. Specifying the component name, title, and description
3. Creating the component files and documentation
4. Adding the component to the component registry

## Integration Guides

### Iframe Integration

The Blackboard Content Hub uses iframes to embed interactive components into Blackboard courses. Our [Iframe Integration Guide](./iframe-integration/) provides comprehensive information on:

- Basic iframe implementation
- Security considerations
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility
- Cross-origin communication
- Responsive design
- Integration with Blackboard
- Testing and validation
- Troubleshooting

### GeoGebra Integration

[GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/) is a powerful mathematics software that provides interactive visualizations for various mathematical concepts. The Blackboard Content Hub includes comprehensive documentation for integrating GeoGebra into your components:

- [GeoGebra API Overview](./geogebra-api/)
- [GeoGebra Integration Guide](./geogebra-api/integration-guide/)
- [Core API Methods](./geogebra-api/core-methods/)
- [Construction and UI Controls](./geogebra-api/construction-and-ui/)
- [Event Handling](./geogebra-api/event-handling/)
- [File Format and Data Exchange](./geogebra-api/file-format-data-exchange/)
- [Initialization and API Access](./geogebra-api/initialization-and-access/)
- [File Formats and Scripting](./geogebra-api/file-formats-scripting/)

### Other Libraries

The Blackboard Content Hub also supports integration with other libraries and frameworks:

- **D3.js**: For data visualization
- **Three.js**: For 3D graphics
- **MathJax**: For mathematical notation
- **Chart.js**: For charts and graphs

## Best Practices

### Iframe Implementation

When implementing iframes for the Blackboard Content Hub, follow these best practices:

1. **Security**: Always use HTTPS for iframe sources and set appropriate sandbox attributes.
2. **Performance**: Optimize your components for performance, including lazy loading and minimizing dependencies.
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure your components are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
4. **Responsive Design**: Design your components to work well on all devices and screen sizes.
5. **Cross-Origin Communication**: Use postMessage for secure communication between the iframe and the parent page.

For more detailed information, see the [Iframe Integration Guide](./iframe-integration/) and [Iframe Best Practices](../.agent/knowledge-base/iframe-best-practices.md) documents.

### Documentation

Good documentation is essential for the usability and maintainability of your components. Each component should include:

1. **Overview**: A brief description of the component and its purpose.
2. **Features**: A list of the component's features and capabilities.
3. **Usage**: Instructions for embedding and using the component.
4. **Implementation Details**: Technical details about how the component is implemented.
5. **Educational Applications**: Information about how the component can be used in educational contexts.

## Build and Deployment

The Blackboard Content Hub uses a build system to process components and documentation for deployment to GitHub Pages. To build and deploy the project:

1. **Build**: Run `npm run build` to build the project.
2. **Deploy**: Run `npm run deploy` to deploy the project to GitHub Pages.

The build process:

1. Builds the Jekyll site from the docs directory
2. Copies components from shared/components and courses directories
3. Copies shared resources (styles, scripts, libraries)
4. Optimizes assets
