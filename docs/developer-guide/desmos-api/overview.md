# Desmos API Overview

This section provides comprehensive reference documentation for the Desmos APIs:

- [Desmos Calculator API v1.10](./calculator-api.md) - API for the standard Desmos graphing calculator
- [Desmos Geometry API v1.10](./geometry-api.md) - API for the Desmos geometry tool
- [Desmos 3D Graphing API v1.11](./3d-graphing-api.md) - API for the Desmos 3D graphing calculator

These reference materials are primarily for developer use when implementing interactive Desmos components within the Blackboard Content Hub. The documentation covers initialization, core methods, event handling, and other essential aspects of working with the Desmos APIs.

## When to Use Desmos

Desmos is particularly useful for:

- Creating interactive mathematical visualizations
- Building explorable explanations for mathematical concepts
- Developing dynamic problem-solving tools
- Illustrating geometric principles and 3D mathematical concepts

## Integration with Content Hub

When implementing Desmos components:

1. Follow the [iframe integration guidelines](../iframe-integration.md) for embedding Desmos calculators
2. Use the appropriate API version based on your specific needs
3. Implement proper event handling for interactive components
4. Consider performance implications when embedding multiple calculators

For implementation examples and best practices, refer to the specific API documentation pages.
